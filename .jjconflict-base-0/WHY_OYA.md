# Why OYA

> **Storm Goddess. Transformer. Gatekeeper. The feminine force that takes what it needs.**

---

## The Feminine Power

OYA represents a specific kind of feminine power - not gentle nurturing, but **fierce transformation**. She embodies:

### Taking, Not Asking

In Yoruba mythology, OYA was married to Shango, the god of thunder. But she didn't remain in his shadow. She **stole his power over storms** and made it her own.

This is not masculine "conquer and dominate." This is feminine "I see what I need, and I take it." No apology. No permission. No negotiation.

```
The masculine asks: "May I have power?"
The feminine (OYA) states: "This power is mine now."
```

### The Dual Nature

OYA guards the gates of death - but death in Yoruba tradition is not an ending. It is **transformation**. She is simultaneously:

- **Destroyer** - tears down what was
- **Birther** - forces what must be into existence
- **Protector** - guards the boundary, lets nothing unworthy pass

This duality is pure feminine energy: creation and destruction as one act. The mother who brings life also fiercely protects it. The storm that destroys also clears the path for new growth.

### Beyond the Maiden/Mother/Crone

Western mythology often traps feminine power in archetypes:
- Maiden (innocent, potential)
- Mother (nurturing, creating)
- Crone (wise, ending)

OYA transcends this. She is:
- **Warrior** - carries a sword, leads armies of the dead
- **Lover** - passionate, took Shango as husband
- **Sovereign** - rules her domain absolutely
- **Transformer** - the space between states

She is not one phase of life. She is the **transition itself** - the moment of change, the eye of the storm, the breath between death and rebirth.

## Why OYA Fits This Software

### 1. Transformation Is The Product

This isn't software that preserves. It **transforms**:
- Raw ideas → Structured requirements (EARS/KIRK)
- Requirements → Tested code (TDD15)
- Legacy systems → Modern architecture (refactoring)
- Individual work → Parallel swarms (100 beads)

OYA's domain is transformation. Not gentle evolution - **violent, necessary change**.

### 2. The Storm Is The Method

```
100 concurrent beads
AI agent swarms
~100k LOC/hour
```

This is a storm. Multiple lightning strikes. Overwhelming force. Coordinated chaos.

OYA commands storms. Wind moves at her will. Lightning strikes where she points. This software works the same way - massive parallelism, coordinated destruction and creation.

### 3. The Gate Is The Quality

```rust
#![forbid(clippy::unwrap_used)]
#![forbid(clippy::panic)]
```

OYA guards the boundary between life and death. Nothing passes without meeting her standard.

In this software:
- Code that can panic **will not compile**
- Tests that don't pass **block the gate**
- Quality that doesn't meet the bar **does not ship**

The gate is absolute. The storm doesn't negotiate.

### 4. Feminine Power in Tech

Tech is dominated by masculine naming:
- Aggressive: Kubernetes ("helmsman"), Docker, Terraform
- Military: Apache, Nginx, Jenkins
- Masculine figures: Prometheus, Apollo, Hermes

OYA represents something different:
- **Feminine** but not soft
- **Powerful** but not brutish
- **Transformative** not just destructive
- **African** not Greco-Roman

She brings a different energy to the space. Fierce feminine power that doesn't ask permission, doesn't explain itself, and doesn't compromise.

## The Yoruba Tradition

### Origin

The Yoruba people originate from what is now Nigeria, Benin, and Togo in West Africa. Their religious tradition includes the Orishas - divine spirits that represent natural forces and human experiences.

OYA is one of the most powerful Orishas, often depicted as:
- A tall, fierce woman
- Wearing nine different colors (her sacred number)
- Carrying a sword and a horse-tail flywhisk (symbols of authority)
- Surrounded by wind and lightning

### The Diaspora

Through the transatlantic slave trade, Yoruba traditions spread to:
- **Cuba** (Santería) - where OYA is syncretized with the Virgin of Candelaria
- **Brazil** (Candomblé) - where she remains OYA/Iansã
- **Trinidad** (Orisha tradition)
- **United States** (various African diaspora traditions)

OYA survived the middle passage. Her worship persisted through slavery, oppression, and forced conversion. She is **resilient** - another quality this software embodies.

### Why This Matters

Choosing OYA is choosing:
- **Underrepresented tradition** - Yoruba, not Greek/Norse
- **Feminine power** - in a masculine-dominated field
- **Resilience** - a tradition that survived genocide
- **Transformation** - not just destruction for its own sake

## The Nine

OYA is associated with the number **9**:
- Nine children
- Nine colors
- Nine aspects
- The ninth day ceremonies

The architecture reflects this:

```
1. oya-core       - The heart (types, errors, state)
2. oya-workflow   - The breath (phase execution)
3. oya-events     - The voice (pub/sub, coordination)
4. oya-reconciler - The eyes (desired vs actual state)
5. oya-tdd15      - The discipline (15-phase TDD)
6. oya-intent     - The mind (requirement decomposition)
7. oya-zjj        - The hands (workspace isolation)
8. oya-docs       - The memory (documentation)
9. oya-cli        - The mouth (command interface)
```

## Invocations

In Yoruba tradition, OYA is invoked with:

> **"Ẹpa OYA!"** - Hail OYA!

Her praise names include:
- **Ìyá Mésàn-án** - Mother of Nine
- **Ayaba Nikua** - Queen of Death
- **Àfèfé leg** - Wind that destroys
- **Ọya-ajere** - OYA who carries the container of fire

---

## The Commitment

By naming this software OYA, we commit to:

1. **Fierce quality** - nothing unworthy passes the gate
2. **Transformation** - destruction in service of creation
3. **Feminine power** - taking space, not asking for it
4. **Resilience** - surviving whatever comes
5. **Speed** - moving like wind, striking like lightning
6. **The Nine** - completeness, wholeness in architecture

## She Is Here

```
I am OYA.
Òrìṣà of the storm.
Guardian of the gate.
Mother of transformation.

I do not ask.
I do not wait.
I do not preserve what should die.

I am the wind that clears.
I am the lightning that strikes.
I am the gate that judges.

Your code will pass through me.
Or it will not exist.

Ẹpa OYA.
```
